Embeddable circuit board to boost battery input to 5V intended for small robots. Useful access is provided to two logic level convertors for Neopixels, and a 3.3V regulator. Input and output are protected with PTCs, with the option to not populate with a solder jumper. Castellated connectors enable this circuit board to be added either surface mount or with through-hole 0.1" headers.
